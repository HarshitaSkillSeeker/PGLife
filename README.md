# PG Life Web Application

PG Life is a Full-Stack Web Application developed during my Internshalla Full Stack Web Development Internship Training. Guided by my mentors, I created this web application based on my understanding and knowledge, customizing it to include functionalities designed to enhance the user experience.

The entire web app is fully responsive and operational on any device. It is hosted on GitHub, and you can access the project repository here: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/username/PGLife).
